Custom ini configuration files, Supplementary files (RadASM2 and RadASM3 help files), etc.

RadASM3 can be found here: https://bitbucket.org/obaby/radasm3.0-sourcecode/src/master/



Note: Paths in ini configuration files will potentially need to be changed
to reflect your development environment

Note 2: The help file for RadASM3 is very very very minimal, as a result,
I've included the RadASM2 help file. Where I find it really matters is
when dealing with the configuration files and the built-in variables the
IDE uses and expands to values (i.e. $A, $R, $C, etc.)
